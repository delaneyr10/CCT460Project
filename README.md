Final Project for CCT460 - Advanced Web Design at Sheridan College

This was the final project for CCT460 - Advanced Web Design at Sheridan College (unfortunately, the complete site has been
taken down as I am no longer a student at Sheridan). The assignment was to develop a website on any topic using a WordPress
theme as a base, then modifying the code and the child theme to customize it. The project involved developing five inner
pages, designing wireframes, navigation, and design elements, using HTML5 and CSS3 while adhering to best practices and 
website development standards.
